This folder contains R analysis scripts, data CSVs, and saved model objects used for DHGLM and mixing models analyses for the paper "Disentangling individual specialization: insights from individual diet variation in a marine mesopredator"

Contents

The 'data' folder contains the raw isotope data for gentoo penguins P. papua.
The 'dhglms code' folder contains the R script detailed commented for double-hieraquical mixed models analysis and visualization.
The 'isotopic niche code' folder contains the R script detailed commented for estimate the isotipic niche ellipses at individual and population level.
The 'mixing models' folder contains the R script detailed commented for mixing models analysis and visualization.

The .rds model files were generated by the analysis scripts; they are binary R objects. Do not edit them by hand.
Plots in the current workflow use ggplot2 and in-session usage observed ggridges (density ridges) and patchwork or gridExtra for arrangement.
If you only need to generate figures and summaries from existing models, load the .rds files and run the plotting/summary sections of the analysis scripts rather than refitting.
